This will show some examples of the images as result of experiment with the sable difusion in Automatic 1111 google collab.

The collab used for this was found (here)

test images:

havent figure out how to test it locally yet wiht this template.. 

![AI cat](../../assets/images/post0/cat1.png)
![AI cat](../../assets/images/post0/cat2.png)
![AI cat](../../assets/images/post0/cat3.png)
![AI cat](../../assets/images/post0/cat4.png)

The next test was to with adding the different strength to the prompt such as (keyword:2) and ((keyword)).

Found out the reason for the multiple subjects was due to using the image size 1024x1024 which was four times the trianing size of images 512x512

Apparently if the strength of the prompt is adjusted so much their remains a lot of noise in the image as can see:
